**Understanding Client-Server Architecture**


As we proceed on our journey into the world of IT, we begin to realise that certain concepts apply to many other areas. One such concepts is â€“ Client-Server architecture.

Client-Server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.

In their communication, each machine has its own role: the machine sending requests is usually referred as "Client" and the machine responding (serving) is called "Server".
